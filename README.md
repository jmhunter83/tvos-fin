> **Note:** This project has been officially renamed to **Reefy** on GitHub. It is an independent project, not affiliated with or endorsed by [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org) or [Swiftfin](https://github.com/jellyfin/swiftfin). It is a fork of Swiftfin, developed separately with a focus on Apple TV.

## About

**Reefy** is a native Jellyfin media client built exclusively for Apple TV. It uses VLC for direct playback and is designed to feel native on tvOS.

I forked Swiftfin to build a **modern, fully-functional client that keeps up with tvOS and Jellyfin**. The goal is simple: access your videos with current features and a polished experience.

This project focuses purely on the tvOS experience — no iOS, just Apple TV.

## Features

- **tvOS 18 Liquid Glass** — Native glass transport bar with tvOS 17 fallback
- **Redesigned playback controls** — Clean layout in bottom 15% of screen
- **Native progress slider** — Pill-shaped, 8px height
- **Full-screen item views** — Proper detail views, not cards
- **Improved focus states** — Smooth scale animations on button focus
- **tvOS 18+ compatibility** — Sheet presentation and TextField fixes

## Beta Program

**Reefy is currently in public beta.** Join to get early access and help shape the future of Apple TV media players.

### Why I built this

I forked Swiftfin with a simple goal: **get something modern, fully working, and up to par with tvOS**. I wanted to access my Jellyfin videos without dealing with outdated apps, broken navigation, or missing features.

### What makes Reefy different

- **Modern tvOS experience** — Native focus states, smooth navigation, tvOS 18 Liquid Glass effects
- **Redesigned playback controls** — Clean transport bar that feels like Apple's own video players
- **Fixed what was broken** — Resolved memory leaks, navigation traps, and stability issues from the original fork
- **VLC-based playback** — Wide codec support for all your media files
- **tvOS-native UI** — Full-screen detail views, native progress slider, proper remote interaction

### Beta Tester Requirements

- Apple TV (tvOS 17+ recommended, tvOS 18+ for full effects)
- Jellyfin media server (any version)
- Willingness to test and provide feedback

### What I'm Looking For

I need testers who will:
- Actually use the app day-to-day
- Report bugs and usability issues
- Suggest improvements based on real usage
